# Linear Time Series Assignment - ARIMA Modelling and Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on modeling and forecasting a time series dataset of the industrial production index (IPI) for the French economy. The chosen dataset tracks the monthly production volume of the Cocoa, Chocolate, and Confectionery Products sector in France, adjusted for seasonal variations and working days. The data spans from January 1990 to March 2025.
The dataset provides insights into the sector’s production dynamics, reflecting long-term trends, cyclical fluctuations, and the impact of significant events. The data reveals periods of stability, decline, and growth that correspond to changes in market demand, production processes, and external economic shocks.
